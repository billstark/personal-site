            Took part in Computing for Voluntary Welfare Organisations during the first summer vacation in the university. Participated in the whole process of developing a website for Lions Befrienders, particularly developed info/referral record and home visit record, implemented typeahead, file attachement and version control. During the process, I have got familiar with the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern as well as the Ruby on Rails framework. In addition, I have learnt some ideas of code maintenance and database design. <br>

            Worked as a full-stack web developer at ViSenze for 3 months. During the internship I got familiar with AngularJS, Python, Java Spring and Jenkins. I learnt the basic development cycle of small projects. I helped with backend maintainess, continuous integration, UI design & implementation and some of the user experience testing. I was well integrated into the working environment and really enjoyed the 3-month internship experience.
